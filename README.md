# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
The data consists of 1000 observations of 157 pixels from images containing handwritten digits. 

This is an implementation of a clustering technique using K_means algorithm. The algorithm is implemented from scratch without the use of any toolkits. This model helps in classifying handwritten digits by learning from the existing model.
